#### Programming Problem Solving
**Steps for Problem Solving**:
1. Read the problem completely twice
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
3. Optimize the manual steps
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
6. Optimize the real code

> "If you don’t ask the right questions, you don’t get the right answers. A question asked in the right way often points to its own answer. Asking questions is the ABC of diagnosis. Only the inquiring mind solves problems.”

The _five whys_ and _five hows_ are a questioning process developed by Sakichi Toyoda. This technique is meant to "drill down into the details of a problem or a solution and peel away the layers of symptoms."

This method of insistantly asking "why" and "how" can bring clarity to a problem and get to the roots. It can be used when working with a team and brainstorming, or just with yourself when you're stuck on a problem or solution.
