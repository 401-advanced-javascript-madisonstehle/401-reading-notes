### Discussion Questions
1. **What is the benefit of breaking up HTML webpage content into components?** Having components can DRY up code. It will also make it easier to make universal changes to the site, like having the models in JS.
2. **What is JSX? Why is it useful?** JSX stands for JavaScript XML and allows for JS and HTML to be written together. This is useful so that we _can_ manipulate components of the site.
3. **What can cause a render (or re-render) of a component?** The state of the component.
4. **When a render happens, how is the DOM affected?** It appears within the DOM.
5. **What is one thing a framework does that a library doesnâ€™t do?** A framework is rigid and controls what happens when certain code is ran, a library is a collection of tools to speed up development.
