### Discussion Questions
1. **What's a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?** OAuth "standardizes how independent web applications can share user data without sharing passwords". 
2. **Write the following steps in the correct order:**
  - Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
  - Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
  - Receive authorization code
  - Make a request to the access token endpoint
  - Receive access token
  - Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
  - Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
3. **What can you do with an authorization code?** It allows a server application to request an access token
4. **What can you do with an access token?** You can request from and PI endpoint to get user data or carry out user actions
