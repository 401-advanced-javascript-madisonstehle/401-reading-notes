### Discussion Questions
1. **What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?** It means that the communication between the connection and the socket server are two-way. This is good because information can be sent back and forth.
2. **Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?** Yes, socket.io use both HTTP and TCP. It uses HTTP to validate the connection between the client and server and keep the connection active.
3. **What happens when a client emits an event? What happens when a server emits an event?** The server hears an event that the client emits, then responds some way, perhaps doing something with the payload included with the event emission.
