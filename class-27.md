### Discussion Questions
1. **Why do custom hooks need the `use` prefix?** This tells the linter that it's okay for the function to utilize hook functions inside it.
2. **What do custom hooks usually do?** They can help us modularize our code and return stateful variables.
3. **Using the links above, list one custom hook that you would be interested in trying/using.** There are so many. useAuth and useRequireAuth seems really useful!
