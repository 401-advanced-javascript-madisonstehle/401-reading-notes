### Discussion Questions
1. **What is a data structure?** A data structure is a collection of data values, with the purpose of working on it with various algorithms. It is the way we are able to store and retrive data.
2. **How is a Linked List different from an array?** An array is more rigid than a Linked List. A Linked List is a sequence of `Nodes` that are connected (or "linked") to each other. Each `Node` contains some data AND a reference to another `Node` in the list. 
3. **What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array?** When dealing with arrays, it can be costly to add or delete in languages like C++ or Java. It is much easier to add or remove `Nodes` from a Linked List.
4. **What data does a `Node` hold in a doubly Linked List?** Each Node holds a link to the next _and_ previous `Nodes`, this means that you can move forward and backward through the Linked List.
5. **What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variableâ€¦?)** I'm guessing that classes would be beneficial for a Linked List, so that you can utilize object properities, and easily add instances.
