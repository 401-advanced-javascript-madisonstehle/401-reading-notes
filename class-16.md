### Discussion Questions
1. **Given the examples of front-end events such as button click, window resize, form submit, etc, what are some examples of back-end events?** Routing for information, async calls, auth/auth
2. **Why are events sometimes better than asynchronous actions with callbacks?** You can easily assign multiple listeners to an event, but having a lot of callbacks on one thing can get messy really fast.
3. **What does an EventEmitter instance do?** It is an exported class that allows us to raise new event s and to listen to events that have been raised.
4. **When is a programâ€™s call stack, event queue, and event loop active?** Whenever the application is running and doing things, this process is running, with the application constantly checking if the call stack is empty.
