### Discussion Questions
1. **Why might you want to create a FormInput component?** `FormInput` could bundle an input field, the handler, and a label!
2. **Can a parent component access the state of a child component?** State variables are local access only, _however_, information can be passed through props. 
3. **What can be passed along in a prop variable?** Prop variables can send static variable data or even entire functions!
