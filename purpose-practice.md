# Purpose Practice Sheet

### Pinpoint Your Values
- **What motivates me to get up in the morning?** I don't do anything, especially things that require work and effort, without having a reason. I get up in the morning because there are things I need to do to support and better myself, and in order to provide an environment where my loved ones can better themselves. 
- **What keeps me up at night?** Normally, I stay awake at night thinking of all the things I need to do. But more lately, thinking about this new world we've been living in has been keeping me up.
- **What am I doing when I'm at my best?** At my best, I go outside, eat regularly, and make time for relaxation. 
- **Why am I bothered by what bothers me?** The things that bother me most are the little things that keep me from doing the important things I need to do. They bother me _because_ I want to focus on the struggles I want to focus on, and not get caught up trying to find a missed bracket or a spelling error in my code, so to speak.
- **Why do I do the work I do?** I do the work I do for two main reasons: one, because people count on me to do it, and two, so that I can get closer to my goals.
- **Why do I buy what I buy?** The things I buy play into who I am, whether that's something I use to express myself (clothes, candles, books, etc.) or something to further my self development (classes, hobbies, etc.).
- **Why do I long for what I long for?** I pretty much just long for what I would like to become. I long to be able to competently code, I long to move into the mountains, I long to build a life where I can focus on things that make me more me, I long to provide an environment for my partner to grow and develop more easily.
- **Why do I read and watch what I do?** I like to read things that I find interesting. I like to watch things that take some of the anxiety off of life, so I watch a lot of comedies.
- **Why do I admire whom I admire?** I admire people who can truly help others and take care of themselves. I admire that because I would like to be like that.
- **When am I happy?** I am happy when I have either accomplished something, helped someone else meaningfully, or when I have a moment of peace and quiet.
- **Why do I have the relationships that I have?** My relationships are founded on trust, honesty, and understanding - things that are highly important to me.

### Consider Your Options 
- **List your opportunities** 
  1. Learn to give myself the same grace I give others
  2. Learn to speak up for myself
  3. Learn to have confidence in my abilities, even if it's just my ability to learn from my mistakes
- **List your core values**
  1. Empathy
  2. Authenticity
  3. Intrasubjective Deference (For those experiences I cannot know, I defer to those who have; a lack of my understanding does not invalidate the subject)
  4. Introspection
- **What have you decided is your purpose?** Right now, my purpose is to create a life for myself and my partner.

### Make Room for What You Love
##### Maximize 
- Being outside
- Drinking tea, listening to music, lighting candles, reading a book
- Playing any instruments I have
##### Minimize 
- Stressing out so much that I spiral
- Beating myself up for not doing things when I am in a depressive state
- Being mad at myself when I don't learn something as fast as I think I should be able to

### Filter By Purpose 
##### When you're feeling out of sorts about what's going on in your life, or if you're trying to decide if a new opportunity fits your purpose, use these questions to filter() through to an answer.
- What core value does this fit with?
- What level of excitement do I have about this?
- Will / does this distract from something else that is very important to me?
- How might this play out in the future?
