### Discussion
- **What is native development?** A native app, or native application, is a software application built in a specific programming language, for the specific device platform, either iOS or Android. Native iOS apps are written in Swift or Objective-C and native Android apps are written in Java. ([Native Apps, Web Apps or Hybrid Apps? Whatâ€™s the Difference?](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/native-web-or-hybrid-apps/))

- **Why is it important to develop a native app vs a responsive react app?** The cons of native apps are time and money, while the pros are the quality of the product and the wide range of development possibilities. If you are looking for an engaging experience, and your site is transactional, needing more interactions than read and go, then native applications have better performance, increased functionality, and enhanced security for users.
