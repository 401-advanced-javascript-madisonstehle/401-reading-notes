### Discussion Questions
1. **Why is authentication important?** So that sensitive personal identifying information doesn't get into the wrong hands.
2. **Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?** Because people (even devs working on the site) could gain access to that and use the informatiion in a malicious way.
3. **What is the difference between hashing and encryption?** Hashing is a type of encryption algorithm method used to secure data, usually passwords
4. **What is the difference between encryption and encoding?** Encryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires the use of a key to decrypt the information. Encoding is not used for securing data, but is used to transform data into a more readable form for systems or external processes. 
5. **What is a token used for?** A token is used to verify the encrypted data.
