## DSA: Trees

### Discussion Questions
1. **What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes?** A leaf `Node` has no subsequent edges or connections. It's important so that we know when to stop when traversing down the tree.
2. **Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre, in, and post order?** Post is like left-to-right and bottom-to-top order, and you're starting at the bottom, so it's "post" root. In order is completely left-to-right, so it's "in order" like we would read something in one line. Pre is top-to-bottom and left-to-right, and it's like starting at the beginning and the root has to be looked at first, so maybe that's why it's called pre-order.
3. **What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for?** the height of a fully balanced tree is 2^(h-1). I honestly have no idea what it is used for. Maybe searching?
4. **How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?** They are really good for visualizing how the traversal works with the tree, since we have to use recusion.
