### Discussion Questions
1. **Why is access control important? Describe an application that would need access control.** Access Control is important so that we can restrict permissions for resources. So this means that changing abilities to see, change, or delete items.
2. **What is a role used for?** A role is for describing a set of permissions and grouping them into an umbrella of capabilities.These could be _admin_, _editor_, _user_, or _guest_.
3. **Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?** Mandatory and Discretionary access control could get really overwhelming really quickly if lots of people are requesting access. Whereas Role-Based reduces the workload on whoever owns and controls access to resources.
