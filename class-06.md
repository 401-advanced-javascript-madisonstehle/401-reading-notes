### Discussion Questions
1. **What does protocol mean?** A protocol is a set of rules that must be followed. In this context, our protocol (HTTP) was developed as a way for clients and servers to interact over the web in a consistent way.
2. **How does any web browser understand how to open any webpage?** The HTTP is like a set of schema for request and response objects, so that they have consistents points of contact for a web page trying to read it.
3. **Name one thing a request object must have, and one thing a response object must have.** A request object must have a `method`. A response object usually has a `status`.
4. **What is the difference between HTTP and REST?** HTTP is the set of rules that requests/responses follow, but REST is the set of guidelines that dictate how to format a server's APIs.
5. **Why is REST important?** REST is important so that the client can easily access all the methods/functionality needed.
