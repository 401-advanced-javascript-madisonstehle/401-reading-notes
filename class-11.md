### Discussion Questions
1. **Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a stack.** A stack would be really useful if you needed to reverse something.
2. **Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a queue.** A queue seems like it would be good for addressing issues that people have, like a help desk.
3. **Why are pop, push, enqueue and dequeue always O(1)?** These are all doing the same number of steps every time they're invoked, and it doesn't matter how many items are in the stack or queue.
4. **Why do stacks and queues not have traversal or searching operations?** They are meant to be limited and efficient, stacks following LIFO (Last In First Out) implementation and queues following FIFO (First In First Out) implementation.
